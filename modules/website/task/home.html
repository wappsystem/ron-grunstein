    				<h2>Sleep is an essential part of life. You spend approximately 33% of your life sleeping.</h2>
    				<p>While we donâ€™t know exactly why we sleep, scientists have shown that lack of sleep or disturbed sleep has serious health consequences.</p>
                    <p>My clinical practice is focused on helping people with sleep problems. Our research group has shown over 15% of Australians are sleep deprived, more than 20% of middle-aged men have some form of sleep apnea and 5% of our community suffer from insomnia. These problems have serious implications for the individual and society.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this website is to provide some information about sleep and sleep disorders, my clinical practice and our research based at the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney Local Health District and other sites.</p>
